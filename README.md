<h1 align="center">Hey ❤️, Churkenberg is in touch</h1>

### A little bit about me:    
I'm a junior data analyst, I already know how to do various tasks, from prediction, to writing SQL query. I'm still studying, although who doesn't study, I'm looking for a job at the same time. I am eager to join a friendly team of analysts and take part in various interesting business tasks.

🌱 I am currently pumping my analytics skills, learning ml little by little and doing projects.

### Social resources and communication: 🌐
I will be sincerely grateful if you join my telegram, in it I will try to share new projects and interesting information.

And to contact me, there is Gmail, which I often read, and I don't miss a single message.
